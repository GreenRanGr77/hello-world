# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm a Builder and Innovator using my Graphic Design skills to create a better world.
I grew up writing and drawing mostly of anime and video games those are my inspiration.
Being a Graphic Designer is one of the best decisions I"ve made in my career because it allows me to learn the fundamentals and necessary abilities to create and design the type of art that moves peoples minds into greater spaces and allows artistic expression.
